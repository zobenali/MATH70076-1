Through the Pixar Dataset,  I aimed to show various aspects of Pixar going beyond just the “money” aspect. While revenues are key indicators of a renowned company, I also wanted to explore the public's reception and the professionals behind it using Eric Leung’s dataset.

For financial charts, I used a secondary-axis bar chart to show Pixar’s budget and revenue evolution. This approach simplifies comparisons over time.

To visualize critical reception, I opted for a map rather than a traditional bar chart, making it more engaging. This visualization highlights correlations between revenue, nominations, and average public's perception. It thus gives a sense of the impact of the 'nostalgia factor' in a movie appreciation.

For style's guidelines, make sure that,in the bar-chart, _Box-Office_ and _Budget_ are in complementary colors. For the map, a special attention should be made on the zone color-filling: use 4 distinct coulours and light opacity. Finally, for the graph, if the displayed is not legible, do change the graph type to _‘bipartite’_. It would be less appealing but far more legible.

I tried to respect the graphics style guide as best as I can. However, I did not succeed in implementing and installing the right font in R. Also, the callouts in the barchart are not exactly as expected. I thought it was a bit overloading. 
For the color palettes, I followed the recommended colors but I think  more dynamic and vibrant colors would suit best Pixar’s Universe.

For future refinements, I would improve the Pixar contributors' graph to emphasize the professionals roles in each film. Another thing I thought about was to work with the illustration and artistic team for an illustration to this small article, maybe something with barplots looking like characters of the Pixar Universe. You would find a figure of sketches I made for some characters.
